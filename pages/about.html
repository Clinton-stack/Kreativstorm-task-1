        <h3> Brief history about Liverpool</h2>
        <p> 
            <b>Liverpool Football Club </b>is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. <br>
            The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. <br>
            Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation.

        <p>
            Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world.<br> 
            The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. <br>
            Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. <br>
            The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".
